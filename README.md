# GameEngine
This is a hobby project being developed only by me for entertainment and learning purposes, as well as using it in future game jams.
The project is developed 100% with C#, with the only exception being the use of the Raylib_cs package, a C# Binding for the Raylib Library. The engine is made with the intention of making games entirely with coding and no editors.
Feel free to make your own contributions if: you so desire to try to extend my spaghetti code.
